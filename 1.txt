The simplest way to understand how AI and ML relate to each other is: AI is the 
broader concept of enabling a machine or system to sense, reason, act, or adapt
like a human. ML is an application of AI that allows machines to extract
knowledge from data and learn from it autonomously.

Artificial Learning is the capability of a computer system to mimic human
cognitive functions such as learning and problem-solving. Through AI, a
computer system uses math and logic to simulate the reasoning that people use to
learn from new information and make decisions

Cyber security is primarily about people, processes, and technologies working
together to encompass the full range of threat reduction, vulnerability reduction,
deterrence, international engagement, incident response, resiliency, and recovery
policies and activities, including computer network operations, information
assurance, law enforcement, etc.
